+++++ Version control mini-bootcamp using git +++++

Before we get  started, note that any  line that follow "$"  will be a
command that you enter on the command line.

With that said, let's begin.

PART ONE -- Creating and maintaining a local repository:

First, let's get jump  into the "code" directory on our  VM so that we
can set up a new repository (which we will delete later).

From your home directory:

$ cd code

Create a new directory to use for testing git and move into it:

$ mkdir git_test
$ cd git_test

Git is called  using the command "git".   To see what you  can do with
git, you can run "git help".

Now, let's we need to initialize our repository:

$ git init

This creates a special hidden directory  called ".git", you can see it
by running "ls  -a".  In this directory, git  stores information about
the repository  and tracks changes.   Generally, you won't have  to do
anything inside this directory.

By default,  the repository won't  track any  files until you  tell it
to. Files that  exist in the directory, but haven't  been added to the
repo (short for repository) will be marked as an "untracked file" when
you type "git status".   To see the full list of  markers used by "git
status",  run "git  help status".  Note, "git  status" will  only show
information  about files  that have  been added,  changed, or  removed
since the last time a commit was made to the repository.

Now, let's create a file and then  add it to the repo (while running a
few other commands along the way):

$ touch dummy_file.txt
(Note: "touch" is just an easy way to create an empty file)
$ git status
$ git add dummy_file.txt
$ git status
$ git commit

You'll  get an  editor  window that  expects you  to  record a  commit
message.  Commit messages are very important for keeping track of what
changes when into a particular commit. Even though it is very tempting
to be lazy with commit messages, detailed commit messages will be more
useful to you  down to the road than something  along the lines "added
more stuff to the repo".

USE QUALITY COMMIT MESSAGES.

For example, I might put something like:

"Added the first file to the repository.

This file is a dummy file that contains no information but was created
for the purpose of testing out git."

Note, it is  useful to put a short, yet  descriptive, one-liner at the
beginning  of  a commit  and  then  put  a more  detailed  explanation
below. The first line  will be used by git in the  output of "git log"
and can useful for keeping the log short but informative.

As I just  suggested, to see the  current history of the  repo, we can
run:

$ git log

As the number  of commits build up,  the ouptut of "git  log" will get
long.  Since log  output revision information from the  most recent to
the least recent, looking at the most recent changesets often involves
having to  scroll up in your  terminal window adding "|  more" to your
"git log"  call will  allow you to  step through the  log at  your own
pace.

Revision numbers are  useful for moving between  different versions of
the code, we'll see an example of that in a bit.

Just to  make sure we've locked  down the basics of  committing, let's
add another  file, but this  time, open  it using your  preferred text
editor (again, I'll be using emacs) and put in some information:

$ emacs not_just_a_dummy_file.txt
(write a couple  sentences and then save  and exit  the file)
$ git add not_just_a_dummy_file.txt
$ git commit
$ git log | more

At this point, we can see the commits we've made and everything should
be looking  good.  Now, let's open  up that file we  just commited and
change something:

$ emacs  not_just_a_dummy_file.txt
(Add, remove, or  edit something in the file. Save and exit)
$ git status

Git is showing that we've modified  that file.  That's great, but what
if we  want to see exactly  what we changed?  That's  where "git diff"
comes in:

$ git diff

Git shows us what files in the  repo have been changed and how they've
been changed -- very useful!

If I'm happy with the changes, I  can go ahead and commit the modified
file.

$ git commit -a (Make sure to put a useful commit message!)
$ git log | more

OK, great, we're making and tracking changes.  What else can we do?

Thanks to version  control, not only do we have  access to the history
of our repository, but we can also  go back to any previous version of
the code.

Let's say  we wanted  to see what  the code was  like before  our last
commit.   Using "git  log",  we can  get the  revision  number of  the
previous commit and then "checkout" the version of that code.

$ git checkout [first 6 digits of revision number] not_just_a_dummy_file.txt
(Note:  the first  6 digits of  the revision number are in the "git log" file)

Git tells us that it updated the files to match the requested revision
number.   Take a  look at  not_just_a_dummy_file.txt.  It  should look
like the version you committed before you made your change.

It is important to  keep in mind that we have moved  to a past version
of the code, if  we were to make a change now and  commit it, we would
be changing that old version and the commit process would create a new
"HEAD".  You’ll learn  more about heads as you  work with repositories
more, but for now  let's just get back to the  most current version of
the code:

$ git checkout HEAD not_just_a_dummy_file.txt

Without  specifying the  revision number,  just the  word "HEAD",  git
jumps  us right  back to  the "tip"  of the  code --  the most  recent
version.

Now, let's make  a couple more changes  to the code.  We'll  add a new
file with some text in it and edit not_just_a_dummy_file.txt:

$ emacs another_file.txt
(write a couple things in the file, save, and exit)
$ git add another_file.txt
$ emacs not_just_a_dummy_file.txt
(make a change or two, save, and exit)
$ git status

Now, we can  see that we added another_file.txt (marked  as "new") and
modified not_just_a_dummy_file.txt.

Let's say we think about the state of our code for a bit and we decide
we don't like the changes me made to not_just_a_dummy_file.txt, but we
don't want to go  back in by hand and change it back,  in this case we
need to "revert" the file to the state it was in at our last commit:

$ git checkout -- not_just_a_dummy_file.txt
$ git status

Now   we   see    that   we   still   have   the    added   file   and
not_just_a_dummy_file.txt is not longer  marked as "modified", but now
we also  have not_just_a_dummy_file.txt~.  This extra file  is because
git wants  to make sure we  don't accidentally revert a  file and lose
changes that we  meant to keep. If we're happy  with the current state
of our repo, we can go ahead and commit again:

$ git commit -a

Finally, let's say  we've gotten a little carried away  with all these
files we've generated and we want to thin things out by getting rid of
dummy_file.txt.  We could try doing:

$ rm dummy_file.txt
$ git status

Uh oh, dummy_file.txt is now marked with as "deleted".  This indicates
that the file was deleted, but not with an git command, so it is still
being tracked.  If we want to actually remove a file from our repo, we
need to commit this change.

$ git commit -a

That's it for exploring what you  can do with a local repository.  The
next section will  walk you through how to interact  with a web-hosted
repository, specifically the one we will be using for this course.


PART TWO -- Using a Bitbucket hosted git repository:

Now  we’re   going  to  clone   a  repository  that   already  existed
remotely. To  do this, create  a directory somewhere on  your computer
where you’re OK with putting the repository and then do the following:

$ git clone https://bitbucket.org/devinsilvia/rcr_spring_2016_git

If you  were to  go to  that URL,  you would  see the  repository that
already  exists  and  you  should  see  that  the  properties  of  the
repository  match the  one that  was just  cloned.  The  clone command
downloads a  copy of  the current state  of the repo,  as well  as its
history, from Bitbucket.

Once you've  cloned a repository,  you can make  changes to it  in the
exact same way that we outline  in Part 1.  However, making changes to
the version hosted  on Bitbucket is a little bit  different. Let's see
how that works.

Starting from the root directory of the repository:

$ cd vc_testing

This is  the directory where we  will test out the  process of working
with  remote repositories.  Each of  you should  create new  directory
using your MSU NetID as the name.

To set this up for today, do the following:

$ mkdir <MSU NetID>
(Note: use  your personal NetID where it says <MSU NetID>)
$ cd <MSU NetID>

Now  create a  file called  "push_test.txt" in  that directory.   Once
you've  created the  file, add  it to  the repository  and commit  the
addition.

Did everything go smoothly?  Check on the current state of your repo.

Now, if you're confident everything looks good, you're going to "push"
this  change  to  the  class  repo.   If  you're  not  convinced  that
everything is right, ask one of us to check!

Let's push that change:

$ git push

Git should prompt you for your  Bitbucket password, once you enter it,
the file you created will be pushed up to the class repo. If this goes
through with  out an  error, check that  your file is  now on  the web
version repo and jump down to "Pulling new changes:" below.

Otherwise...

If you  are not the first  person to push a  new file, you may  get an
"abort" message saying that your push  will create a new head. This is
normal and part  of collaborative repository development.   If you get
his message skip down to "If you get an 'abort' message:" below.

>>> Pulling new changes:

Once another student (or several) pushes their own file, we'll be able
to test  out how  to pull changes  that have been  made to  the remote
repo.

Assuming other's have pushed files, let's pull:

$ git pull

It important to realize that "git  pull" does not actually change your
local version of the repository,  it merely acquires information as to
the list of  changes that have been made.  If  you want to incorporate
those changes, you have to "update" the repo:

$ git fetch

You  should now  see  other student  directories  in the  “vc_testing”
folder as  well as their  version of push_test.txt.  Read  through the
following section to understand what would have happened if you hadn't
been the first student to push your changes.

>>> If you get an 'abort' message:

Now, what happens if you're  currently working on a repository, you've
made a commit, but someone else was simultaneously working on the same
repository and  they pushed  their changes before  you did?   You just
encountered the result.  Since git doesn't want to foolishly overwrite
the work  someone else has committed  to the remote repo,  it requires
that you first pull the remote  changes, merge them into your version,
and then let's you push the merged version.

So, let's do that:

$ git pull

Git will pull the  changes and let you know that  you've pulled down a
new "head".   This is a result  of changes that other  students in the
class have  made.  We  need to merge  that head into  our own  so that
we're all working with the same repo:

$ git merge

Assuming that the merge process  doesn't run into any conflicts (we'll
certainly run into that down the road), Git will update your code with
the changes you  pulled down and remind you to  commit the merge.  For
commits involved merges, it is relatively common practice to include a
commit message that says "Merged." or "Merging changes."

Do that commit now and don't forget to push your merge!  (Warning: you
may run into further "abort" messages since we're all actively pushing
changes, just  repeat the above  process until everything  gets merged
in.)


At this point,  you should have a decent understanding  of how to push
and pull  changes to a remote  repository.  If you didn't  yet have to
deal with a merge, you certainly will  at some point, so make sure you
followed the directions outlined above.   At this point you should ask
any questions you have about what we've done so far.  If you want more
practice with Git, check out the links in Part 3.


PART THREE -- Explore on your own!:

Now let's work  through the tutorials available  on Software Carpentry
(http://software-carpentry.org).  There is one for git, located here:

http://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/

That will walk you  through git in a way similar  to this short guide,
but should give you a deeper understand of its functionality/power.

Good luck and happy coding!
